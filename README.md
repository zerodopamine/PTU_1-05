Creates a roll20 json for easy pokemon generation.

On roll20 you can import json by selecting the "Import Page" button on the top left of the sheet just below the "Pokemon Tabletop United" Image ("Core Page" should be selected in dark gray by default". This is found in the Character Sheet tab of the character, it is not in "Bio & Info" or "Attributes & Abilities".

Once you have clicked on the "Import Page" button, copy and paste the output of the code into that screen and then click the white "Import".

Importing via json does not allow for updating the usage of moves (i.e Scene x2) or selecting stab so this will still need to be done manually.
